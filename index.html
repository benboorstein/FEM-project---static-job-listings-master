  </head>

<!-- Basics of how the page works (keep for now):
1) what prompts the appearance of the filter? Maybe going to a particular job posting and then clicking on one of this job posting's "Frontend"/"Senior"/"HTML"/"CSS"/"JavaScript" buttons?
  - Correct. On page load, there's no filter section. As soon as a user clicks on one of the technology 'pills' a.k.a. 'tags', the filter section will appear, showing that selected tag.
2) what items/descriptors are included in the filter upon its initial appearance?  Maybe with ALL POSSIBLE descriptors ("Frontend" and "Senior" and "JavaScript" and "CSS" and "HTML" and "Junior" and "React", and so on)?
  - By the time the filter section appears, it will include one 'tag', the one the user just clicked to begin filtering.
3) what exactly is the filter doing? Is it presenting only the job postings with the descriptors (e.g., "Frontend" or "Senior" or "JavaScript") present in the filter?
  - Correct. It is keeping track of the selected tags, and only presenting jobs with all of those tags, among any others that job may feature
